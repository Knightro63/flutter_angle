## Getting started

To get started add flutter_angle to your pubspec.yaml file.

## Usage

This project is a simple rendering engine for flutter to view 3D models and complex shaders.

## iOS issue

If you have used ios or ios-simulator and get an error pod not found FlutterAngle ~> 0.0.8. Delete Podfile.lock, change directory to ios folder and run `pod install --repo-update`.
